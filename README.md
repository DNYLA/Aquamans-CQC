## Teleport GUI
The Teleport GUI/Dialog is simple although it will be remade in the future as it can be tricky to add more controls onto it. In the new dialog i will us a listbox instead of buttons. This makes it easier for people to add in custom spawns/areas.

## Virtual Vehicle Spawner
Instead of using DNA's NMD Vehicle spawner or the built in Vehicle Spawner i made a custom Vehicle Spawner which is sorted by most commonly used vehicles first. Its easier to navigate and find a vehicle over DNA's Vehicle spawner because there are only 10 vehicles to chose from.

## Other Features

### Respawn on Same Location
The Respawn script teleports the player back to the same location they died at. For Example if you died at OG you will automatically be teleported back to a random spawn point in OG. This means that you don't have to select OG from the teleport Dialog every time you die. If you would like to return back to spawn to chose another location you have to open up the Magazines Menu and click Spawn.

### Magazine Menu
The Magazines Dialog is used to restock on Ammo when you are running low however it does not restock firt aid kits as Medkits are permanant and should be used over FAK's. Clicking the Spawn Button will teleport you back to spawn when you next die.
